	<h4>Robot Soccer - Python(PyGame)</h4>
	<p>In my intro to programming class, I created a game based off the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html" target="_blank">PyGame</a> skeleton. The objective of this game was for a robot to place a ball into the goal. There were randomly generated cones that blocked the robot’s path.

	</p>

	<h4>Train Organizer/Optimizer - C++</h4>
	<p>For my Data Structures final project, we had a “make it yourself” project in C++. For my project, I decided to create a train organizer. For this program, the user fed a text document into it and it organized a train to fully optimize it. The optimization as based on type (liquid, gas, or solid) then amount. For liquids and gases, they couldn’t mix. For solids, they were based by cubic volume size and combined into different train carts. This program was made using the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">Codeblocks IDE</a> with C++.

	<h4>Photo Manipulator - Java</h4>
	<p>
	For my programing class, I created an image manipulator for jpegs. This program let you upload a photo and add a filter to it. I programmed the filters according to a matrix that I was given. This program was made using the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">BlueJ IDE</a> with Java.

	<h4>Spirited King</h4>
	<p>This ghostly spirit was created in <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank">Rhinoceros 3D</a> . It was inspired after urban artist’s graffiti. I modeled the object as one item.

	<h4>3D Printed Robot</h4>
	<p>This robot was modeled in <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank">Rhinoceros 3D</a> and printed on a <a href="https://www.lulzbot.com/products/lulzbot-taz-5-3d-printer" target="_blank">Lulzbot Taz 5</a>. The base of this robot was based off a Transformer’s robot mode. The head was specifically designed after an Autobot called <a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" target="_blank"> Ultra Magnus</a>. The final printed robot was an actually articulated figure. After extensive trial and error, I ended up modeling this with all ball joints as they seemed to work the best.

	<h4>3D Animated Cartoon</h4>
	<p>This project was created in <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. It was a short samurai fight animation done for my Form(ATLS2500) class.

	<h4>MyCUCalendar</h4>
	<p>This was a user experience project designed with a few classmates in my User Centric Design(CSCI3002) class. The goal was to create a calendar that integrated schedules from our class registration portal (MyCUInfo) onto an online platform.
	</p>

	<h4>Sound Detection Helmet</h4>
	<p>
	This is a physical computing project made with an Arduino micro controller. For this project, I used a Sparkfun <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13975" target="_blank">Redboard</a> and a Sparkfun <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12758" target="_blank">Electret Microphone Breakout</a>. The idea was to have the LED array on the mouthpiece of the helmet to change colors when you spoke. The LEDs went from red to green upon voice detection. This was done by using two seperated outputs on the Redboard.

	<h4>Wireless Blind Spot Detection</h4>
	<p>
	This was a semester long project for my Invention and Innovation class. I collaborated with three other students for this (Sean Connolly, Elijah Fisk, and Alex Schwartz). The goal of this project was to create an easy to install and use blind spot detection system for cars. We had an external unit that was attached to the quarter panel of your car and would detect if something was in your blindspot. We also had a unit on the inside of your car to read and interpret the data from the external sensor. This unit also display a light visual upon interpretation. The light was white if your blindspot was clear and red if there was an object. The lights also showed a rainbow effect if you weren't connected to the external sensor. 
	
	<br>
	<br>
	The base of this project was the Arduino platform and bluetooth modules. We experimented with various components for this including cheap Ebay microcontrollers, Arduino Unos, Sparkfun Redboards, Sparkfun Promicros, Ebay bluetooth modules, Sparkfun Silver bluetooth modules, xBee bluetooth modules, cheap ultrasonic sensors, and weather resistant ultrasonic sensors. In the end, we used two sets of Sparkfun Promicros and xBee bluetooth modules. For our sensing unit, we used a $15 weather resistant ultransonic sensor. For our output unit, we used a strip of RGB Neopixels to alert the user.

	<h2>Future Projects</h2>

	<h3>3D Printed Transformer</h3>
	<p>
		I would like to eventually have the knowledge to 3D model and 3D print a working Transformers figure.
	</p>
	<h3>Mobile App</h3>
	<p>
		Eventually I would like to create a mobile video game. Not quite sure what this game will be like, but it would probably be a small simple platform game.
