	<h4>Robot Soccer - Python(PyGame)</h4>
	<p>In my intro to programming class, I created a game based off the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html" target="_blank">PyGame</a> skeleton. The objective of this game was for a robot to place a ball into the goal. There were randomly generated cones that blocked the robot’s path.

	<h4>Train Organizer/Optimizer - C++</h4>
	<p>For my Data Structures final project, we had a “make it yourself” project in C++. For my project, I decided to create a train organizer. For this program, the user fed a text document into it and it organized a train to fully optimize it. The optimization as based on type (liquid, gas, or solid) then amount. For liquids and gases, they couldn’t mix. For solids, they were based by cubic volume size and combined into different train carts. This program was made using the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">Codeblocks IDE</a> with C++.

	<h4>Photo Manipulator - Java</h4>
	<p>
	For my programing class, I created an image manipulator for jpegs. This program let you upload a photo and add a filter to it. I programmed the filters according to a matrix that I was given. This program was made using the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">BlueJ IDE</a> with Java.

	<h4>Spirited King</h4>
	<p>This ghostly spirit was created in <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank">Rhinoceros 3D</a> . It was inspired after urban artist’s graffiti. I modeled the object as one item.

	<h4>3D Printed Robot</h4>
	<p>This robot was modeled in <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/" target="_blank">Rhinoceros 3D</a> and printed on a <a href="https://www.lulzbot.com/products/lulzbot-taz-5-3d-printer" target="_blank">Lulzbot Taz 5</a>. The base of this robot was based off a Transformer’s robot mode. The head was specifically designed after an Autobot called <a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" target="_blank"> Ultra Magnus</a>. The final printed robot was an actually articulated figure. After extensive trial and error, I ended up modeling this with all ball joints as they seemed to work the best.

	<h4>3D Animated Cartoon</h4>
	<p>This project was created in <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. It was a short samurai fight animation done for my Form(ATLS2500) class.

	<h4>MyCUCalendar</h4>
	<p>This was a user experience project designed with a few classmates in my User Centric Design(CSCI3002) class. The goal was to create a calendar that integrated schedules from our class registration portal (MyCUInfo) onto an online platform.
	</p>


	<!-- <p>The goal of this project is to create a working calendar that can use your MyCUInfo class schedule, Desire2Learn, and the CS Moodle to create an academic calendar. The plan is to implement a Google calendar into a Web and Mobile interface that can import multiple types of calendars. I am working with two other students in my User Centric Design(CSCI3002) class.

	<h2>Future Projects</h2>

	<h3>3D Printed Transformer</h3>
	<p>
		I would like to eventually have the knowledge to 3D model and 3D print a working Transformers figure.
	</p>
	<h3>Mobile App</h3>
	<p>
		Eventually I would like to create a mobile video game. Not quite sure what this game will be like, but it would probably be a small simple platform game.
