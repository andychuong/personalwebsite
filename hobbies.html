	<h2>Past Projects</h2>

	<h3>Pygame - Robot Soccer</h3>
	<p>In my intro to programming class, I created a game based off the PyGame skeleton. The objective of this game was for a robot to place a ball into the goal. There were randomly generated cones that blocked the robot’s path.
	</p>

	<h3>Train Organizer - C++</h3>
	<p>For my Data Structures final project, we had a “make it yourself” project in C++. For my project, I decided to create a train organizer. For this program, the user fed a text document into it and it organized a train to fully optimize it. The optimization as based on type (liquid, gas, or solid) then amount. For liquids and gases, they couldn’t mix. For solids, they were based by cubic volume size and combined into different train carts.

	<h3>Photo Manipulator</h3>
	<p>
	</p>

	<h3>Spirited King</h3>
	<p>This ghostly spirit was created in Rhinoceros 3D. It was inspired after urban artist’s graffiti. I modeled the object as one item. 
	</p>

	<h3>3D Printed Robot</h3>
	<p>This robot was modeled in Rhinoceros 3D and printed on a Lulzbot Taz 5. The base of this robot was based off a Transformer’s robot mode. The head was specifically designed after an Autobot called Ultra Magnus. The final printed robot was an actually articulated figure. After extensive trial and error, I ended up modeling this with all ball joints as they seemed to work the best.

	<h2>Current Projects</h2>

	<h3>3D Animated Cartoon</h3>
	<p>This project will be created in Blender with a comic I will be drawing. The goal of this project is to have a working 3D printed figure along with a short animated movie.
	</p>

	<h3>MyCUCalendar</h3>
	<p>The goal of this project is to create a working calendar that can use your MyCUInfo class schedule, Desire2Learn, and the CS Moodle to create an academic calendar.
